<h2>Hello, I'm Neil ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>I currently work for a UK Catapult Research Centre focusing on implementing manufacturing-as-a-service through private cloud infrastructure via Openstack. I also do some machine learning stuff relating to cognitive load and trust for human robot interaction as well as some whitepaper writing.</p>

<p>This space is usually where I have my homelabs, personal system configs or book accountability repos.</p>
