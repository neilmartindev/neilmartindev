I'm a software engineer from the UK. I work in a private consultancy for machine automation, controls and instrumentation. I also spend my spare time at a local aerospace company that develops commercial rockets that have a gros weight of around 2,500kg / 5000lbs.

I work with both front end and back end technologies and not afraid to get stuck into something technical.
