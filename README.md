---
I'm a software engineer from the UK mainly working in machine automation, controls and instrumentation.

I work with both front end and back end technologies and not afraid to get stuck into something technical.

- :books:  Education: BSc(Hons) in Computer Science and currently studying a MEng in engineering.
- :speech_balloon: Ask me about: C#, DOTNET, Python, Linux, Docker and any other technologies that you can think of!
- :calling: How to reach me: neilmartindotdev@protonmail.com
